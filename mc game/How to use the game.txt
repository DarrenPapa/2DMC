Author: Darren Chase Papa
Current Verion: 0.1-a (In development)

==== [ How to play ] ====
1. Placing And Removing blocks:
To place blocks right click on a empty space.
To remove blocks left click on a block.
2. Using blocks:
To use a block right click it the game will run a script in the assets/scripts/ folder that has the block name it just needs to be a raw text file.
3. Choosing/selecting blocks:
To change the block you can place use the left and right arrow keys.

==== [ Creating custom blocks ] ====

To create blocks that are simple and doesnt have a script,
just make a texture of 656 by 656 pixel size and put it in the assets/textures folder restart the game and youll have the block just scroll and find its name hell it can just be a screen shot!

To create scripts put a text file that has a existings blocks name and when that block is used it will run the text file you created.

The script file (in this case the text file) is initiated with this modules and info (note the script is only run when you use the block):
mb - Tkinters messagebox module
os - The os standard library
pos - Where the block is (a tuple of the x y coordinates)
tui - A simple gui function i made to get input from the user.
data - Just a dictionary that can be accessed by the other scripts.
grid - The grid where the blocks are stored (look in the bomb script it uses this to achieve the explosive effect).
play - A function to easily play sound files (must be wav or ogg format)
